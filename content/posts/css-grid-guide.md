# CSS Grid Layout: A Complete Guide

CSS Grid is a powerful layout system that makes creating complex, responsive web layouts easier than ever before.

## Why CSS Grid?

Before Grid, we relied on floats, positioning, and flexbox hacks. CSS Grid provides:

- Two-dimensional layout control (rows AND columns)
- Precise positioning without absolute positioning
- Responsive design without media query overload
- Clean, semantic HTML

## Basic Grid Setup

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: auto;
  gap: 20px;
}
```

This creates a 3-column grid with equal-width columns and a 20px gap between items.

## The `fr` Unit

The `fr` (fraction) unit is Grid's superpower:

```css
.container {
  grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr 1fr;
}
```

This creates three columns where the first takes up twice the space of the others.

## Grid Template Areas

Named areas make layouts incredibly readable:

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas:
    "header header header"
    "sidebar main main"
    "footer footer footer";
  grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr 1fr;
}

.header {
  grid-area: header;
}
.sidebar {
  grid-area: sidebar;
}
.main {
  grid-area: main;
}
.footer {
  grid-area: footer;
}
```

## Responsive Grid

Create responsive layouts without media queries:

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
  gap: 20px;
}
```

This automatically adjusts the number of columns based on available space!

## Advanced: Overlapping Elements

```css
.item-1 {
  grid-column: 1 / 3;
  grid-row: 1 / 3;
}

.item-2 {
  grid-column: 2 / 4;
  grid-row: 2 / 4;
}
```

## Browser Support

CSS Grid is supported in all modern browsers:

- Chrome 57+
- Firefox 52+
- Safari 10.1+
- Edge 16+

## Tips & Tricks

1. Use `grid-auto-flow: dense` to fill gaps automatically
2. Combine Grid with Flexbox for ultimate layout control
3. Use `minmax()` for flexible but constrained sizing
4. DevTools grid inspector is your best friend

## Conclusion

CSS Grid revolutionizes web layout. Once you master it, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it.
